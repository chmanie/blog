Please hire me. 

My name's Chris and I'm an electrical engineer gone developer gone electrical engineer. Let me explain. After finishing university I couldn't find my place in the typical German engineering space. So I turned to coding instead as that always fascinated me (I wrote my first text-adventure at the age of 13).

My passion for creating hardware came back much later, when I - after fiddling with a bunch of Arduino projects - was tasked to <a href="/chess.mp4" target="_blank">make</a> <a href="/mr_circuit.mp4" target="_blank">props</a> for a pop-up Escape Room, here in Berlin.

After almost burning out during a long, dragging blockchain-gig I decided to go all in and put my time where my mind was: creating musical instruments. Not being a <a href="https://i.redd.it/2mbv2tc3maf41.png" target="_blank">musician</a> myself but deeply entangled in the ins and outs of music creation, the beauty of its math and the resulting sonic experiences I saw it as my purpose to enable musicians to be inspired by their instruments and just do what they do best. I'm still on my path there, gathering knowledge and <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~chmanie/grow" target="_blank">building</a> <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~chmanie/miditron">machines</a> that primarily educate myself but yet are useful. 

Joining you wonderful bunch of people would take me a big step forward in reaching these goals. In my time of working exclusively for myself I found that a thrive when interacting with people, collaborating on projects and learning from each other. I do miss that dearly and am hoping to find that with you. To me it seems that you can provide the freedom that I need for learning and realising my own ideas and at the same time be challenged by ambitious projects that are unique and new and exciting! The aspect that you're a tight-knit, interdisciplinary group building almost everything in-house is particulary compelling to me. I'd love to expand my horizon in manufacturing real-life objects (don't get me wrong, I'm no stranger to soldering irons, 3D printers or laser cutters - but there's always so much more to learn).

If you have questions, please reach out, I'd be happy to be in touch :)

Best,

Chris
